First, we need to create a new Spring Boot project and add the required dependencies for web, JPA, and Liquibase.
Next, we need to create the necessary databases and tables for each microservice. We can use Liquibase to manage database ,schema changes and versioning. We'll define the database schema changes in separate changelog files for each microservice.
We can create separate Java classes for each microservice, with each class responsible for handling its specific functionality. so added basic implementation for the ApplicationService microservice, ProductMatrix Service.
